Development of a trading bot algorithm

Problem Statement:

In the cryptocurrency market, there is a recurring challenge where some coins are not listed immediately after their Initial Public Offering (IPO). This delay creates uncertainty among investors and traders, as the impact of listing on coin prices remains unclear. This lack of timely and actionable information prevents the crypto community from making informed buy/sell decisions, leading to missed opportunities or poor investment choices.

The project is aimed at developing AND testing an intelligent trading bot for  cryptocurrencies listing on Binance  using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms and sentiment analysis on python. The project provides the following major functionalities:

Defining derived features using custom (Python) functions including technical signals
Analyzing historic data and training machine learning models 
Analyzing the predicted scores and choosing best signal parameters once a coin is listed on Binance


Hypothesis

Hypothesis 1: Prices tend to rise immediately after listing.

Hypothesis 2: High volatility occurs right after the listing.

Hypothesis 3: Do prices decline in the long term?

Hypothesis 4: Is there an opportunity for arbitrage to develop risk-efficient and profitable trading strategies?
